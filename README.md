Library for running Ecovacs Deebot (and also some yeedi) vacuum cleaner robots

## Installation

Information on how to install this library can be found [here](https://github.com/mrbungle64/ecovacs-deebot.js/wiki/Installation).

The minimum required version of Node.js is 14.x. It is recommended to use version 14.x or 16.x

## Usage

Information on how to use this library can be found [here](https://github.com/mrbungle64/ecovacs-deebot.js/wiki/Usage).

## Models

### Supported models

The supported models are those that I own myself:

* Deebot Slim 2
* Deebot 900/901
* Deebot OZMO 930
* Deebot OZMO 920/950
* Deebot T8 AIVI (T8 series)

### These models should work properly or at least partially

The following models are either already known to work or are technically similar to these models.
Nevertheless, the functionality may be partially limited.

I try to achieve a wide range of functionality, but decide this case by case depending on complexity and various other criteria.
There is of course no claim to full functionality.

#### Ecovacs Deebot

* Deebot N79 series
* Deebot M88
* Deebot 500
* Deebot 600/601/605
* Deebot 710/711
* Deebot OZMO 610
* Deebot OZMO 900/905
* Deebot OZMO Slim 10/11
* Deebot U2 series
* Deebot N8 series
* Deebot OZMO T5

* Deebot X1 series

#### yeedi (experimental)

## Known issues

* The generation of map images is currently not stable on 32-bit systems (e.g. most Raspberry Pi systems)
* The cleaning log has an empty result on T9 series
* "Edge" command does not work with Deebot U2 (starts auto clean instead)
