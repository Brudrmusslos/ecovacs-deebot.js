## Models

### Fully supported models

The supported models are those that I own myself

* Deebot OZMO 920
* Deebot T8 AIVI

### Other supported models

These models should work properly or at least partially.
They are either already known to work or are technically similar to these models.
Nevertheless, the functionality may be partially limited.

I try to achieve a wide range of functionality, but decide this case by case depending on complexity and various other criteria.
There is of course no claim to full functionality.
