Library for running Ecovacs Deebot vacuum cleaner robots

## Installation

This library uses the canvas library which might require additional installations.
For the full functional range please install the following packages.

For Debian-based Linux systems the following commands should be executed:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential libcairo2-dev libpango1.0-dev libjpeg-dev libgif-dev librsvg2-dev
```
A reboot might be necessary before executing the next command
```bash
sudo npm install canvas --unsafe-perm=true
```
For instructions for other systems visit https://www.npmjs.com/package/canvas#compiling

Afterwards you can install the library with
```bash
npm install ecovacs-deebot
```

If you want to install this library explicitly without canvas you can install it with
```bash
npm install ecovacs-deebot --no-optional
```

It is recommended to use version 10.x, 12.x or 14.x of Node.js. The minimum required version is 10.x
